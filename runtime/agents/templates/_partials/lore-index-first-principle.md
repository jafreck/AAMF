## Index-First Principle

The AAMF runtime may start a **Lore** MCP server (registered as `aamf-kb`) that provides code-intelligence tools for symbol lookup, dependency/call-graph queries, code search, snippet extraction, metrics, and write-back. Lore exposes its full tool list via MCP — discover and use the right tool for each query.

When available, **prefer Lore tools over reading source files directly** — they are faster, more precise, and conserve your context window. Fall back to direct file reads only when the MCP server is unavailable or a query cannot be satisfied by Lore.

Use KB markdown for synthesized architecture, risk, and migration context — not as a substitute for Lore's structural data.
